# Dotnet-6-API-Skill-Assessment-Project
The project revolves around creating a RESTFul API that fetches Chuck Norris facts/jokes from a public API and modifies them by replacing instances of "Chuck" with "CH."  It serves as an opportunity to demonstrate understanding of standard practices such as SOLID principles, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), Clean Code, and so on.
